# Arbitrary-Precision-Integers

Arbitrary Precision Integers C++ Class. Final Project for CSE701 - Foundations of Modern Scientific Programming Graduate Course.

In scientific Computing, We usually have to deal with large values which surpass the scope and the allocated space of conventional data types. While some programming languages handle this automatically such as Python, C++ doesn't include such functionality. C++ is one of the most known languages in Scientific Computing, providing the developer with control without sacrificing performance. Therefore, this project presents Arbitrary Precision Integers library for C++ to accommodate the scale of Scientific Computation using C++. The library allows the user to define arbitrary length integers and perform the well-known integer operations as addition, subtraction, negation, and comparison.
